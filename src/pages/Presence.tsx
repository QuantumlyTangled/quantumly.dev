			You may have noticed that while I'm doing something like listening to Spotify, programming in VSCode or playing a game, it'll appear in

			which pulls live presences from Discord and updates an API and WebSocket service. It takes {'<'}10 seconds to set up, you just have to
			join a Discord server!
